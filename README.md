Abstract: The data files contains isotopic measurements of in-situ samples and modeled data. Calanus (copepod) sampled by the CPR survey in the North Atlantic for 2009-2018 were analysed for d13C and d15N values. This observational dataset was used together with environmental variables (SST, MLD, chla...) to develop Bayesian spatial models and to produce yearly and seasonal isoscapes (spatial modelling of stable isotope ratio) for 1998-2020.

File descriptions: Please do not hesitate to contact the corresponding author for more information about the data, here a brief description of the files:
SI_data.csv: d13C and d15N values measured in Calanus sampled by the CPR survey. The values of the environmental variables used to develop the models is also included.
Isoscapes_data: Isoscapes values, rows correspond to latitude coordinates from 40N to 72N, step 0.25 degrees; and columns to longitudes coordinates from -60W to 16E, step 0.25 degrees.
Isoscapes_plot: Graphical representation of isocapes based on data presented above.
Suess_correction: d13C isoscape data are corrected for Suess effect taking 2015 as year of reference. To obtain uncorrected data, please apply these correction factors (see DOI: 10.1111/2041-210X.13622 for more information).
